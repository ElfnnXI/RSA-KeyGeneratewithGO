# 🔐 RSA-KeyGeneratewithGO
RSA-KeyGeneratewithGO is a simple utility written in Go (Golang) to generate RSA key pairs (public key and private key). This project is suitable to be used as a basis for cryptography, data encryption, or digital authentication applications.


#### 🚀 Features
* Generates RSA public and private keys.
* Supports customisable key lengths (e.g. 2048-bit, 4096-bit).
* Stores keys into files in PEM format.
* Simple and easy to understand code structure.

#### 🛠️ Technology
Language: Go (Golang)
Cryptography: crypto/rsa, crypto/rand, encoding/pem

📦 Usage Example

in terminal/cli
```bash
go run main.go
```
#### ⭐ Once run, it will generate:

private_key.pem
public_key.pem
